PRIME NUMBERS 

Program To Print Prime Numbers

The program takes input from a user,the value 2 is appended into the array to enable the working of the algorithm.The loop increases by 2 to ensure that we only work with odd numbers for a boosted efficiency.Inside the loop, the print_prime_number function is invoked.In the function,the loop starts at 2 and ends at a number one less than the input.This is done to ensure that the definitionn of a prime number is adhered to.
The array containing the prime numbers is then printed.
